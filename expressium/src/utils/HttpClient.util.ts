/**
 * ## HttpClient
 * 
 * HTTP client for making requests to the server.
 * 
 * @description This class provides a configurable interface for making HTTP requests
 * to the server. Built on top of the Axios library, it offers a set of methods
 * for handling common HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD) with
 * consistent error handling and authentication support.
 * 
 * Key features:
 * 
 * - Configurable authentication strategies that can be applied globally to all requests
 * - Automatic request ID generation for improved traceability
 * - Type-safe responses using TypeScript generics
 *  
 * @method setAuthenticationStrategy - Sets the current authentication strategy for the client to be applied to all subsequent requests.
 * @method clearAuthenticationStrategy - Clears the current authentication strategy, resulting in unauthenticated requests.
 * @method request - Makes a generic HTTP request with the current authentication strategy and specified configuration.
 * @method get - Performs a GET request to retrieve data from the server.
 * @method post - Performs a POST request to create new resources or submit data.
 * @method put - Performs a PUT request to update or replace existing resources.
 * @method patch - Performs a PATCH request to partially update existing resources.
 * @method delete - Performs a DELETE request to remove resources from the server.
 * @method head - Performs a HEAD request to retrieve metadata from the server.

   * 
   * Common use cases include:
   * 
   * - Replacing an existing resource completely
   * - Creating a resource when the client specifies the ID/URI (PUT to a specific resource URL)
   * - Updating multiple fields of a resource at once
   *

   * 
   * @description This method performs a PATCH request to partially update an existing
   * resource on the server. Unlike PUT requests which typically replace the entire resource,
   * PATCH requests only update the fields provided in the request payload, leaving other
   * fields unchanged.
   * 
   * PATCH requests are designed for making partial modifications to resources and are
   * useful when you want to update only specific fields without having to send the
   * complete resource representation.
   * 
   * Common use cases include:
   * 
   * - Updating specific fields of a resource
   * - Performing atomic operations (increment/decrement counters, add/remove elements)
   * - Making changes that depend on current state (optimistic concurrency control)
   *

   * requests should have the same effect as a single request (the resource is removed).
   * 
   * DELETE requests typically do not include a request body, although some APIs may
   * accept a body for complex delete operations or batch deletions.
   * 
   * Common use cases include:

   * - Batch deletion operations with specific criteria
   * - Clearing collections or caches
